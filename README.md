#TwinPush API Documentation

Twinpush is a platform designed and built with the goal of making the 
process of sending push notifications to users really easy and 
intuitive. With this REST API you can integrate it with your app without using the SDKs.

##What is REST?
It is a style of software architecture for distributed systems based on 
representations of resources and the manipulation of these resources 
through those representations.
